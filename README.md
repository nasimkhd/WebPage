# WebPage

This web is created by me, it is responsive and user friendly.
I used java script in my form section, also I use some features of HTML like nav bar, bookmark,block qutes, class and id. I design my page with CSS which makes my web more beautiful.
I linked my CSS and JS file in my html file. Also, I created another HTML page that shows me the About part. When I click about in the first page it brings me to the second page.
